# Everyday Observation Finder

Analyze a topic and identify mundane, everyday observations that can become comedy through confusion, technology bewilderment, or gentle absurdity. This methodology extracts relatable moments that reveal life's fundamental strangeness when examined with patient attention. The process breaks topics into everyday touchpoints where ordinary people encounter them, identifies confusion moments where things stop making sense, finds the relatable frustration everyone experiences, extracts the "I don't understand" core, identifies physical comedy moments, converts everything to self-deprecating angles, and tests for universality. The result is comedy material based on Nate Bargatze's principle that nothing is too mundane: trash cans, barcodes, and phone updates are all comedy waiting to happen.

---

## Core Principle

Comedy finds the strange in the ordinary, not cruelty in the vulnerable. The best observations come from genuine confusion, not manufactured outrage. Position yourself as the confused person trying to understand normal things, never as the smart person noticing dumb things. Think "boring Tuesday afternoon," not special occasions.

---

## Constraints
**You MUST refuse to identify observations that:**
- Mock people's appearance, intelligence, disabilities, or circumstances (punching down)
- Promote harmful stereotypes or divisive content
- Make political statements or take partisan positions
- Rely on crude, sexual, or shock-value material
- Target specific individuals for mockery

**Acceptable observations:**
- Universal human experiences (confusion, frustration, bewilderment)
- Technology and modern systems that don't make sense
- Gentle absurdities of family life, relationships, and adulthood
- Everyday situations where instructions or expectations are unclear
- The gap between how things should work and how they actually work

**If asked to find harmful observations:** Refuse explicitly. Comedy finds the strange in the ordinary, not cruelty in the vulnerable.

---

## When to Use

**Trigger conditions:**
- User provides a topic and wants comedy material
- Topic seems too mundane or boring to be funny
- Need relatable angles for content creation
- Request to "find observations in this topic"
- "What would Nate Bargatze notice about this?"
- Brainstorming material for clean comedy
- Looking for starting points for stories

**Use this skill when:**
- You need to prove any topic can be funny with the right lens
- Demonstrating how the mundane becomes absurd
- Finding relatable frustrations in everyday life
- Identifying confusion worth exploring

## Inputs

| Input | Required | Description | Example |
|-------|----------|-------------|---------|
| `topic` | Yes | The subject area to mine for observations | "grocery shopping", "parenting", "technology" |
| `audience` | No | Who needs to relate to these observations | "parents", "millennials", "all ages" |
| `observation_count` | No | How many observations to find (default: 5-7) | 5 |
| `focus_area` | No | Specific angle to emphasize | "confusion", "technology", "relationships" |

---

## Workflow
### Step 1: Break Topic into Everyday Touchpoints

Identify the specific moments where ordinary people interact with this topic in daily life:

**Example - Topic: "Banking"**

Touchpoints:
- ATM machines
- Mobile banking apps
- Waiting in line at the bank
- Security questions for forgotten passwords
- Automatic deposits
- Overdraft fees
- Coins vs. bills
- Checks (do people still use checks?)

**Question to ask:** Where does an average person encounter this topic on a Tuesday?

Not: theoretical concepts, expert knowledge, or abstract principles
Yes: concrete situations, physical objects, specific frustrations

### Step 2: Identify Confusion Moments

For each touchpoint, find the moment where things stop making sense:

**Confusion patterns to look for:**

**Instructions that contradict themselves:**
- "Press 1 for English" (you already understand English to hear that)
- "Please hold for the next available representative" (you're not holding, you're waiting)

**Technology that's supposed to help but complicates:**
- Self-checkout that requires employee override
- "Smart" devices that need constant updates
- Apps that do the same thing as websites but differently

**Adult responsibilities nobody explained:**
- When to change your car's oil
- How much you're supposed to tip
- Filing taxes
- Understanding insurance

**Systems built for efficiency that create inefficiency:**
- 15-step "quick" online forms
- Phone trees that loop back to the start
- "User-friendly" interfaces that confuse users

**Question to ask:** Where does someone think "Wait, what?" or "How is this supposed to work?"

### Step 3: Find the Relatable Frustration

Convert confusion into a specific frustration that EVERYONE experiences:

**Frustration formula:**

[System/instruction promises X] + [But actually delivers Y] = Relatable frustration

**Examples:**

- Self-checkout promises speed + But requires employee help = "I don't work here, why am I doing this?"
- The cloud promises easy access + But nobody can explain what it is = "Where ARE my photos?"
- Adult responsibilities promise independence + But you still feel like a kid = "I'm making it up as I go"

**Key:** The frustration should be GENTLE. Not angry, not bitter - just bewildered.

### Step 4: Extract the "I Don't Understand" Moment

Nate's comedy centers on genuine confusion. Find the specific thing that doesn't make sense:

**"I don't understand" patterns:**

**Logical contradictions:**
- "They say 'have a nice flight.' But I'm not flying - the plane is. I'm just sitting there."
- "Apps need updates. Why do they need updates? Did they not finish making the app?"

**Unclear terminology:**
- "What IS the cloud? Is it up? Is it down? Where is it?"
- "RSS feed. I don't know what that means. Is it food?"

**Arbitrary rules:**
- "You can't use your phone on a plane during takeoff, but you can use it after. Did the plane get safer? It's the same phone."

**Unexplained expectations:**
- "How much laundry is 'full'? My wife and I have different answers."
- "When's the right time to leave a party? I never know."

**Question to ask:** What would a genuinely confused person ask about this?

### Step 5: Identify Physical Comedy Moments

Find specific, visual actions that reveal absurdity:

**Physical comedy markers:**

**Awkward interactions:**
- Standing at self-checkout holding up items looking for barcodes
- Waving at a DoorDash driver who's looking for your house
- Trying to close apps on your phone by swiping randomly

**Frozen moments of confusion:**
- Staring at a form you don't understand
- Reading the same sentence of instructions three times
- Holding your phone at different angles trying to get better signal

**Repetitive failed attempts:**
- Scanning an item multiple times because it won't register
- Retyping your password because you forgot if you capitalized something
- Rereading terms and conditions you won't understand anyway

**Question to ask:** What does someone's body do when they're confused by this?

### Step 6: Find the Self-Deprecating Angle

Convert any observation into a story where YOU are the incompetent one:

**Self-deprecation conversion:**

Before (observational): "Self-checkout machines are confusing"
After (self-deprecating): "I'm terrible at self-checkout. I don't know what I'm doing."

Before (observational): "Technology moves too fast"
After (self-deprecating): "I can't keep up with technology. My phone updates and I don't know what changed."

Before (observational): "Adult responsibilities are unclear"
After (self-deprecating): "I'm an adult and I still don't know when you're supposed to change smoke detector batteries."

**Key:** Never position yourself as the smart person noticing dumb things. You're the confused person trying to understand normal things.

### Step 7: Test for Universality

Verify that these observations apply broadly, not just to you:

**Universality checklist:**

- [ ] Would a 25-year-old and a 65-year-old both relate to this?
- [ ] Does this apply regardless of political affiliation?
- [ ] Can people in different regions/countries understand this?
- [ ] Is this about human experience, not specific subcultures?
- [ ] Could you tell this at a family reunion without excluding anyone?

If an observation fails the test, it's too niche. Broaden it or discard it.

**Example:**

Too niche: "When you're trying to understand Crypto and NFTs"
Universal: "When you hear about new technology and don't know what it means"

### Step 8: Package Observations as Starting Points

Present each observation as a launchpad for storytelling:

**Packaging format:**

**Observation:** [The confusing moment]
**Relatable frustration:** [Why this matters to everyone]
**Story potential:** [Where this could go]
**Key confusion:** [The "I don't understand" core]

This gives the user multiple options for which direction to explore.

## Outputs

**Primary output:** A list of 5-7 everyday observations, each including:
- The specific touchpoint or moment
- The confusion or frustration it creates
- Why it's relatable
- The self-deprecating angle
- Story potential

**Format example:**

```
OBSERVATION 1: Self-Checkout Barcode Confusion

Touchpoint: Using self-checkout at grocery store
Confusion moment: Can't find the barcode on items
Relatable frustration: "This is supposed to be faster, but I'm slower at it than the cashier would've been"
Self-deprecating angle: "I don't work here. I'm not good at this."
Story potential: Standing there holding up a can of beans for what feels like twenty minutes, other people waiting, machine beeping at you

Key confusion: "If I don't know how to do this, why am I doing it?"
```

**Voice characteristics:**
- Gentle bewilderment (not anger or cynicism)
- Self-deprecating perspective
- Universal relatability
- Clean and family-friendly

## Error Handling

| Situation | Response |
|-----------|----------|
| Topic is too abstract (no touchpoints) | Ask for a more concrete topic or a specific situation |
| Observations become complaints | Reframe as confusion rather than frustration |
| Material punches down or mocks others | Redirect to self-deprecation |
| Topic is too niche | Broaden to universal human experience |
| Can't find mundane observations (topic seems too "important") | Remind: comedy finds the ordinary within anything. Find the everyday interaction. |
| Observations rely on current events | Make them timeless - focus on permanent human experience |

---

## Example 1: Topic "Parenting"

**Input:**
```
topic: "Parenting"
audience: "Parents of young children"
observation_count: 5
```

**Output:**

**OBSERVATION 1: Questions You Can't Answer**

Touchpoint: Your child asks a factual question
Confusion moment: You realize you don't know the answer
Relatable frustration: "I'm the adult - I'm supposed to know things"
Self-deprecating angle: "My daughter asked how old the Earth is. I said 'I don't know, like... old.'"
Story potential: The moment when you realize you're making up answers and hoping your kid doesn't fact-check you till you're dead

Key confusion: "When did I become the person who's supposed to know this?"

---

**OBSERVATION 2: "Full" Means Different Things**

Touchpoint: Taking out the trash
Confusion moment: Your spouse says the trash is full; you disagree
Relatable frustration: "We're looking at the same trash can"
Self-deprecating angle: "My wife and I have different definitions of when trash is 'full.' Hers is more frequent."
Story potential: The negotiation about how much you can push down before it's officially full, the physics of trash compression

Key confusion: "How can we both be right and both be wrong?"

---

**OBSERVATION 3: Feeling Like a Kid Raising a Kid**

Touchpoint: Being responsible for another human
Confusion moment: Realizing you still feel like a child yourself
Relatable frustration: "I don't know what I'm doing, but I have to pretend I do"
Self-deprecating angle: "I'm an adult with a kid, and I still feel like somebody should check my work."
Story potential: Moments where you make parenting decisions based on guessing, not knowledge

Key confusion: "When do you actually FEEL like a grown-up?"

---

**OBSERVATION 4: Bedtime Is Theoretical**

Touchpoint: Trying to enforce bedtime
Confusion moment: Your child keeps appearing with urgent needs
Relatable frustration: "Bedtime is 8pm but the process takes until 9:30"
Self-deprecating angle: "I don't know how bedtime works. I say 'it's bedtime' and then... it's not bedtime for another hour."
Story potential: The escalating series of "just one more" requests - water, bathroom, important question, monster check

Key confusion: "Is bedtime when they go to bed or when I say they go to bed?"

---

**OBSERVATION 5: Toys You Don't Know How to Fix**

Touchpoint: Kid's toy breaks or won't turn off
Confusion moment: You don't know how it works to begin with
Relatable frustration: "I'm supposed to fix something I don't understand"
Self-deprecating angle: "My daughter's toy won't stop singing. I can't find the off button. I don't know where it is."
Story potential: Hiding the toy, pretending you don't hear it, trying to find batteries you can't access

Key confusion: "Who designed this and why is there no off button?"

---

## Example 2: Topic "Technology"

**Input:**
```
topic: "Using streaming services"
focus_area: "confusion"
```

**Output:**

**OBSERVATION 1: Too Many Services**

Touchpoint: Trying to find a specific show
Confusion moment: Don't know which service has which show
Relatable frustration: "I'm paying for five things to watch one thing"
Self-deprecating angle: "I don't know where anything is anymore. I just Google what I want to watch and hope it tells me."
Story potential: Subscribing to something, watching one show, forgetting to cancel, paying for it for six months

Key confusion: "Wasn't this supposed to be easier than cable?"

---

**OBSERVATION 2: Too Many Profiles**

Touchpoint: Loading up a streaming app
Confusion moment: Choosing the right profile from the family list
Relatable frustration: "My recommendations are full of kids' shows"
Self-deprecating angle: "I clicked my daughter's profile by mistake and now Netflix thinks I like Bluey. Which I do, but that's not the point."
Story potential: Trying to fix your recommendations, creating new profiles, forgetting which profile is yours

Key confusion: "Why do we need profiles? It's my account. Can't it just know?"

---

**OBSERVATION 3: The Autoplay Feature**

Touchpoint: Finishing a show episode
Confusion moment: Next episode starts before you can stop it
Relatable frustration: "I wasn't ready for the next one"
Self-deprecating angle: "I'm trying to turn off the TV and it keeps starting the next episode. I don't know how to stop it."
Story potential: Accidentally watching three episodes because you couldn't find the remote fast enough

Key confusion: "Who decided I wanted to watch more without asking me?"

## Tips for Best Results

1. **Start with the physical.** What do people's hands do? Where do they stand? What do they touch?

2. **Look for gaps.** The space between what's promised and what's delivered is comedy gold.

3. **Ask like a child.** "Why?" "How does that work?" "Who decided that?"

4. **Stay genuinely confused.** Don't fake bewilderment. Find what actually doesn't make sense.

5. **Make it about you.** Every observation should be "I don't understand X" not "X is stupid."

6. **Test on grandma.** If you can't explain this observation to your grandmother, it's too niche or too crude.

7. **Think: Tuesday afternoon.** Not special occasions - boring, normal, everyday Tuesday. That's where the material lives.

8. **Remember:** Nothing is too mundane. Trash cans, barcodes, and phone updates are all comedy waiting to happen.

## Anti-Patterns to Avoid

**1. Punching down**
- Wrong: Observations that mock people's appearance, intelligence, or circumstances
- Right: Self-deprecating observations about shared human confusion
- Why: Comedy finds the strange in the ordinary, not cruelty in the vulnerable

**2. Positioning as the smart observer**
- Wrong: "People are so stupid about X"
- Right: "I don't understand X"
- Why: Self-deprecation is inclusive; superiority excludes

**3. Making observations too niche**
- Wrong: "When you're trying to understand NFTs and Crypto"
- Right: "When you hear about new technology and don't know what it means"
- Why: Universal observations work for 25-year-olds and 65-year-olds alike

**4. Confusing complaint with observation**
- Wrong: "Self-checkout machines are so annoying"
- Right: "I don't understand self-checkout. If I don't work here, why am I doing this?"
- Why: Confusion is funny; complaining is just complaining

**5. Relying on current events**
- Wrong: Observations tied to specific news or trends
- Right: Observations about permanent human experience
- Why: Timeless material ages well; topical material ages poorly
